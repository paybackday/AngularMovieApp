Due to we have not oppurtunity to write backend app for this app, we used to Json Server on our front end program.
While we using json server due to we write json-server --watch <file_name> it is gonna be always watching to destination file.
To create get request to json server or backend side we have to add HttpClientModule in app.module.ts
We added HttpClientModule in app.module.ts but to using we have to inject this wherever we want
ngOnInit means is when the page is loaded. We can use http request in this method.

In this app, we can take some information from json place holder test rest api. To do that we just need to go website of the jsonplaceholder and take the some endpoint adress. We can use this endpoints on our component .ts file.

To can make a request, firstly we have to use http object that come from defined constructor, after that we should use get method of this object. We need to subscribe endpoint. 
Ex: 
this.http.get(address).subscribe(data=>{console.log(data)};) 
or
this.http.get<GenericTypeThatWillConvert>(address).subscribe(data=>{this.varName=data};)

---Error Handling---

Like we can make an error message on the component side, either we can create it on the service side.
When we want to create error handling mechanism, we can use pipe method before subscribing any endpoints.
For example you can inspect on movie component.ts

In this way (pipe in tap method) we can interve before an error occurred and we can personalize error messages.


--ROUTING--
Normally, we are seeing page when we go to main page of program. We should add routing struct into app because if we want to go inside any page or any side from main page it must have related URL.

When we want to add routing mechanism, we can add as a module with using CLI. We should write this command,
ng generate module app-routing --flat --module=app



--VALIDATION--

When we want to create on our movieCreate form, we could create movie with empty inputs. To prevent this we have to use validation.
